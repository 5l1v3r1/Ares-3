# AresStorm
Ares, a high performance and fault tolerant DSPS. Ares considers both system performance and fault tolerant capability during task allocation. In the design of Ares, we formalize the problem of Fault Tolerant Scheduler (FTS) for finding an optimal task allocation which maximizes the system utility. We treat the FTS problem as a game and propose Nirvana, an algorithm based on best-response dynamics scheduling strategy.
